title: "Fundamentals of Storytelling\_ Sunday, February 28th, From 3-6pm First of all, I want to give thanks and big-ups to everybody that was able to join us last Friday, as well as all the support and positivity from all of those that could not be there.  I realize too, that this will reach many of you outside the Chicagoland area but I want to keep you in the loop as well, because rest assured, if you are reading this your presence is very much here in spirit. Your friendship, encouragement and positivity has been very much felt and greatly appreciated. Also, fear not if you were unable to make the opening or were short on time,  \nMy 5 x 5 photos will continue to be available for $10 each and I’m very open to custom orders and collaborations as well, (some exciting ones already in the works!) So, please don't hesitate to hit me up and set up an appointment.With all of that said, as the weather cools down for the moment in Chicago things have already begun heating up here at 828, and straight out the gate, I am really excited to announce the kick off of our “Fundamentals of Storytelling” Series with\_Don Hall(host ofThe Moth)  Studio #828 @The Fine Arts Building.  \nEach of his sessions will cover a single building block of what makes a person with a story a phenomenal teller of stories and provide a no holds barred bootcamp st. Bottom line, you’ll either be leaving with a new skill or a new view of a skill you already possess. There is no charge, but if you gain something from the class, we ask that you please throw a couple of dollars in the hat.   If it's your first time, you will be asked to tell a story, but please don't let that keep you away as I will be right there with you as well as many others.  I’m sure too, that many of you will know someone that may be interested so of course, please spread the word to your friends and Fam.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Thanks again for everything!  Respect!\_\_Phone: 312-725-2154"
